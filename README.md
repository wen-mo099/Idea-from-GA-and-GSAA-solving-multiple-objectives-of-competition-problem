Idea-from-GA-and-GSAA-solving-multiple-objectives-of-competition-problem

We are facing a problem which has a leader and some competition follwers, which is hard to find a easy way to solve. Luckily, the leader's decision is limited so we can use traversal algorithm. Then our problem could be think as a multiple objectives of competition problem. Each follower wants to maximize its revenue rather than total revenue. So our aim is to find a nash equilibrium. Howerve, since there may be many nash equilibriums, we need find the best one. So we use the idea from GSAA to finish the fitness function, there are two objectives we need achieve, total revenue and nash equilibrium. In the beginning, total revenue take advantages in the iteration, but with temper declines, nash equilibrium become more and more important so in the last we can get a nash equilibrium which is closest to golbal optimum(the upper bound of our problme).
